Java File Auto-grading application

Initial Commit: 2016.09.13

This project is under development and is currently being used in a CS1 classroom
In an attempt to increase my own efficiency, and decrease the amount of grading
I have to do, I aimed to create an application that takes student's .java files
submitted to blackboard, then produce grade results in the form of text files
for the individual student, as well as a CSV file for myself. 

Up to this point, I have not been using version control, but this project is
beginning to grow fairly large, so I decided it was time to practice what I 
preach and start using git.

This project was done in NetBeans IDE and uses Maven for build and dependency
management. At the moment, mass grading submissions from blackboard is done
via a batch file on a Windows machine that handles extraction from zip files.

I am aware of the disorganized nature of the code. This will be fixed in 
future iterations of the project.
